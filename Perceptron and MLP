Perceptron 

A perceptron is a type of artificial neuron that:
Takes multiple inputs.
Calculates a weighted sum of these inputs.
Adds a bias term to this weighted sum.
Applies an activation function, typically a step function (also called the Heaviside function).
The output is 1 (activated) if the result is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise the output is 0 (not activated).
The perceptron decides whether to activate based on whether the weighted sum plus bias is ≥ 0. 
The bias helps control the activation point—even if all inputs are 0, it can still fire depending on the bias.

Multi Layer Perceptron 

Instead of a single perceptron, multiple perceptrons are connected to form a deep neural network structure. 
The first layer is known as the Input layer, the final layer is known as the Output layer, and the layers lying between the input and output layers are known as the Hidden layer. 
Each layer could have a different number of neurons.
