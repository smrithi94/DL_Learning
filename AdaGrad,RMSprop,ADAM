AdaGrad
🔹 Key Idea:
Instead of using a single, fixed learning rate η, AdaGrad adjusts the learning rate based on the history of gradients.
-Parameters with large historical gradients get smaller learning rates.
-Parameters with small historical gradients get larger learning rates.
This is useful when:
Some features are sparse (infrequent)
Some features dominate the gradient

For each parameter 
θi, the update rule is:
𝜃𝑖 = 𝜃𝑖 −𝜂 /sqrt(𝐺𝑖+𝜖)⋅𝑔𝑖

Where:
η = initial learning rate
gi = current gradient for parameter 
T∑t=1 𝑔𝑖,𝑡 ^2 = cumulative sum of squared past gradients
ϵ = small value to avoid division by zero (e.g., 10 ^−8)

RMSprop 
RMSprop is an optimization algorithm designed to fix a major limitation of AdaGrad:
➡️ In AdaGrad, the learning rate keeps decreasing because the sum of squared gradients grows indefinitely.

🔹 What RMSprop Does Differently:
Instead of accumulating all past squared gradients, RMSprop keeps a moving (exponentially weighted) average of the squared gradients.
This helps prevent the learning rate from shrinking too much, and keeps training fast and stable.

E[g^2]t = α⋅E[g^2]t−1 +(1−α)⋅gt^2
​
𝜃𝑡 = 𝜃𝑡−1 − 𝜂 /sqrt(𝐸[𝑔^2]𝑡) + 𝜖 ⋅𝑔𝑡

Where:
η = learning rate
𝑔t = current gradient
𝐸[𝑔^2]𝑡 = exponentially weighted average of squared gradients
α = decay rate, usually around 0.9
ϵ = small value to avoid division by zero

Difference between RMSprop and SGD with Momentum

| Feature            | **SGD with Momentum**                     | **RMSprop**                                    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| What it remembers  | **Direction you're going** (velocity)     | **How bumpy** the path has been (variance)     |
| What it helps with | **Speeding up** and **avoiding zig-zags** | **Controlling step size** to prevent stumbling |
| Step size behavior | Same for all directions                   | Different for each direction (auto-adjusted)   |

ADAM 
🧠 Adam Optimizer = RMSprop + Momentum
Adam (short for Adaptive Moment Estimation) combines the best of both worlds:
| Component                  | Comes From        | What It Does                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Momentum**               | SGD with Momentum | Keeps track of the **direction** and builds **speed** in the right direction           |
| **Adaptive Learning Rate** | RMSprop           | Adjusts the **step size** individually for each parameter based on how bumpy it's been |
