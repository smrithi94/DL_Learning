1. Forward propagation:
   ✔️ You start by passing inputs forward through the network using randomly initialized weights.

   ✔️ At each neuron, you apply an activation function (commonly sigmoid, ReLU, or tanh).

   ✔️ The output is compared with the true label, and loss is computed. You mentioned Mean Squared Error (MSE) — this is commonly used in regression problems. 
       For classification, cross-entropy is usually preferred.
2. Error and optimizer:
   ✔️ If the error (loss) is high, we use an optimizer to update the weights.

   ✔️ The most common optimizer is gradient descent (or variants like Adam, RMSProp, etc.)

3. Backpropagation and weight update:
   ✔️ You propagate the error backward using the chain rule of calculus to compute gradients.

   The update rule is correctly written:

   𝑊_new = 𝑊_old − 𝜂 ⋅∂𝐿/∂𝑊
​
   where:
   η is the learning rate

   ∂L/∂𝑊 is the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weight


Each neuron’s output depends on:

the input from the previous layer,the weights and biases,and the activation function.
So to update weights in earlier layers, we apply the chain rule through each layer, like passing gradients backward.
🧠 Example in Neural Net:
Suppose:
L is the loss
𝑎 is the activation
𝑧 is the weighted sum

∂𝐿/∂𝑤 =∂𝐿/∂𝑎 ⋅ ∂𝑎/∂𝑧 ⋅ ∂𝑧/∂𝑤
 
This breaks down as:

How does the loss change with output? ∂𝐿/∂𝑎
​How does output change with net input (activation function)? ∂𝑎/∂𝑧
​How does net input change with weight? ∂𝑧/∂𝑤
​Multiply them to get the full gradient.
