- Build a base model and try to see how it performs based on batch size and epochs. We try to keep batch size and epochs the same. 
- Check the error and accuracy for training and validation set. 
- If we notice overfitting we try out the following. 
   - SGD with momentum , change the momentum as well. 
   - Increase or decrease the learning rates, look for smoother convergences. 
   - Try Adaptive Learning rate (ADAM with multiple learning rate) 
  Keep the learning rate same and try 
   - Dropout (multiple percentages)
   - Batch Normalization
   - Change the initialization techniques. 
   - Try batch normalization and dropout together.
