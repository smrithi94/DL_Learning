Loss function is the error function that is used to evaluate how our model is performing. The main goal of any algorithm in ML or DL is to 
reduce the loss function. In neural networks, the following loss functions are used. 

For regression tasks : we use Mean Squared Error (MSE) 
    reasons - it is easily differentiable and has smoother gradients and it is differentiable at zero and it can help reach global minimum. 
For classification : we use 
    binary cross entropy calculated using 
    Binary Cross-Entropy= −[ylog(y^)+(1−y)log(1−y^)]
    for multiclass classification - with softmax - Categorical Cross-Entropy= − i=1∑n yi log(y^i)
